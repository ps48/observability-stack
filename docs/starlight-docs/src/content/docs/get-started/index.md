The OpenSearch Observability Stack is an open-source, OpenTelemetry-native observability platform. It runs locally via Docker Compose and provides traces, logs, metrics, dashboards, service maps, and AI agent tracing out of the box.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (v2.20+)
- At least 8 GB of available RAM
- macOS, Linux, or WSL2 on Windows

## Installation

Run the interactive installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opensearch-project/observability-stack/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer TUI guides you through component selection and configuration. Once complete, the stack starts automatically.
